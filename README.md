Grammar-Compression-Fuzzing
===========================

This is my Part II Project for the University of Cambridge Computer Science Tripos. The project revolves around implementing grammar compression algorithms known as longest-first-substitution methods alongside an evaluation tactic called gramamr fuzzing.

Important Code
-------------
Most of the important code is in Grammar-Compression-Fuzzing. The test suite is in TestApplication.
 

Installation
--------------

Download everything and open Grammar-Compression-Fuzzing.sln with Visual Studio. The IDE will be able to fetch the needed packages for your from the NuGet information.

At the moment, the project is configured to run a short demo of grammar compression and fuzzing features. You can do this by clicking the green run button in Visual Studio.
